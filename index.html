                <p>My name is Caleb Vincent and was born and raised in Lubbock, TX. I moved to Austin, TX earlier
                    this year in April with the intention to start my education in EMS school. I continued to keep
                    my eye out for any opportunities that would interest me, bringing me here today.</p>

            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>Coding was
                    something I was always aware of, but always seemed so distant. The ability to create and design
                    in a way that helps other people certainly appealed to me, as well with the fact that software
                    developing is the job of the century. A career in software development was not a thing until recently (about 20 years ago) when
                    compared to other jobs that have been common for humanity for thousands of years. New technology
                    is interesting and I want to be on the forefront, creating a new world for everybody. Though, as
                    much as I am a nerd, I love the outdoors even more. In my free time you can find me riding just
                    about anything with 2 wheels, or on a hike with my dog Rocco (if i'm not holed up behind my
                    computer)!</p>
