<p>My name is Caleb Vincent and was born and raised in Lubbock, TX. I moved to Austin, TX earlier this year in April with the intention to start my education in EMS school. I continued to keep my eye out for any opportunities that would interest me, bringing me here today. Coding was something I was always aware of, but always seemed so distant. The ability to create and design in a way that helps other people certainly appealed to me, as well with the fact that software developing is the job of the century.</p>


<p>A career in software development was not a thing until recently (about 20 years ago) when compared to other jobs that have been common for humanity for thousands of years. New technology is interesting and I want to be on the forefront, creating a new world for everybody. Though, as much as I am a nerd, I love the outdoors even more. In my free time you can find me riding just about anything with 2 wheels, or on a hike with my dog Rocco (if i'm not holed up behind my computer)!</p>    </div>
